Monogame Visual Basic Game Engine 5.7

This is my game engine written in VB as it currently exists.

Rewrote fonts because it wasn't displaying properly with SpriteFonts, now exists as GameObj.DrawLetter

Input has a lot of functions for controller buttons, game key state config, and throttle with controller sticks

GameObj supports: Text, Textboxes with preview images, Text effects

Shaders are supported, though I've noticed limited functionality. Regardless you can use DrawInjectShaderBegin, (Your Shader), DrawInjectShaderEnd to add a shader to any sprite

I'm always working on the engine as I create new games, I will attempt to releasemore updates and improve :)

There are a lot of extra functions and things that seem unnecessary, but handle issues that I've ran into with certain prototypes. Feel free to do whatever you want with this, I'm publishing for Ludum Dare purposes.
